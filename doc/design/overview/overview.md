# Tone

Combine the fun, whimsical mix of fairy tale, legend, and mythology akin to the original **King's Quest** series with the the promise of an infinite world of real characters, cities, politics, and guilds promised by the classic role-playing game **Daggerfall**.

# Gameplay

<style scoped>section > * { width : 60% }</style>

#### **Exploration** is where to start

Snowfall is an **exploration** game where the player is rewarded for discovering new characters, locations, history, and making connections in the world.

#### **Contribution** is how to stay engaged

Models, characters, locations, everything is intended to be editable and exportable from within the game. Creating a "mod" is as easy as curating and tweaking a collection of in-game experiences. The "official" distribution lives alongside a set of quality-assured forked distributions and personal mods that are easy to use & share.
