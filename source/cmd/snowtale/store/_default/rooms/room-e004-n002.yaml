name: Cottage Hillside
description: The ascent up the small hill brings you to a modest and quaint cottage, nestled snug against the curve of the hillside. Its walls are skillfully constructed from stones gathered from the meadow, and a tiny chimney pokes out from its moss-covered roof, puffing out gentle wafts of smoke. A lone lamppost stands guard near a weather-worn wooden door, bathed in the warm glow of twilight and painting a picture of homely tranquility so far from the magical turmoil of the fey trail.
