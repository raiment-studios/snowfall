name: Primeval Jungle
description: Delving further west, stepping from the tranquility of the idyllic glade, an overwhelming sensation of nature at its purest consumes the senses. The thicket unravels into a dense, primeval jungle, with towering ancient trees offering a leafy canopy that barely allows sunlight to filter through. The undergrowth is riotous, ablaze with bright colors of curious flowers whose nectar attract peculiar bugs that glow with a captivating iridescence, a stark contrast to the placid life witnessed in the moss-carpeted glade.
