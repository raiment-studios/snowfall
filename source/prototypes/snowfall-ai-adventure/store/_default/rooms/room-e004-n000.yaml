name: Lily Brook
description: At the heart of this verdant dell lies a lonely brook, its crystalline water flowing over a bed of multicolored pebbles. Blooming water lilies are scattered over its surface, their orange files standing out sharply against the gentle sway of the stream. To the east, ancient willows stoop to caress the brook, their leaves teasing its surface, while the fey trail continues subtly through the idyllic landscape, marked by the characteristic quirky mushrooms peeking out from the shoreline.
