name: Meadow's Edge
description: Stumbling upon a patch of light that breaks the endless verdancy, you find yourself standing in the midst of an open meadow. The view holds a stark contrast compared to the forest grove left behind to the west, with wildflowers bobbing their heads in the gentle breeze, creating an enchantment of colors that sway in an almost hypnotic rhythm. To the east, the landscape gradually ascends towards a small hill, its base dotted with a few rogue versions of the quirky mushrooms from the fey trail, encouraging the adventurous spirit to follow its beckoning call.
