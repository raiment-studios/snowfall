name: Sage's Nook
description: In the heart of an ancient, enchanting forest, there's a rustic wooden cabin filled with whimsy. Ornately carved bookshelves stretch to the ceiling, filled to the brim with ancient tomes, trinkets, and curiosities casting odd shadows around the room. A warm, hearty fire crackles in a stone fireplace, illuminating a worn parchment map of Galthea spread on a sturdy oak table, daubed with spots of coloured ink.
