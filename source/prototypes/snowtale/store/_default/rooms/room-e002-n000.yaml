name: Enchanted Forest
description: Venturing further away from the heartening warmth of the cabin's hearth, the player enters a towering, enchanted forest. The scent of rich, burgeoning earth and a stunning array of vibrant greenery engulfs them, providing a sanctuary-like ambiance. Somewhere amidst the dense growth of emerald leaves and majestic tree trunks stretches an unpaved path leading to the east, clustered with a tableau of whimsically shaped mushrooms and ferns, hinting at a well-trodden trail.
