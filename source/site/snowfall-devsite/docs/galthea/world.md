# World

## World layout

From the perspecitve of the game, the world of Galthea is procedurally generated and near "infinite" in size. From the perspective of the lore and world-building, Galthea has a basic structure with some key [[regions]], [[city-states]], and locations that are always present - though the details of these locations may vary. Therefore, the procedural generation needs to work in a way that ensures all elements of Galthea _required_ to be consistent with the lore are in place before filling in the rest of the world.

:::info Development notes
For release v1.0, Galthea is limited to a single continent for simplicity.  
:::

**The general shape of the Galthea is as below.** It is composed a number of "required" regions with roughly the layout below. This is a draft for the first release. All names and details are open to being changed and improved.

## Regions

### Haven

The starting point of the game. Lined with small harbor towns to the southwest. Wayland artifacts are prevalent here, reducing the impact of the Maelstrom.

### Wizard's Crags

A rough, rocky region with sparse population. There are few Wayland artifacts here, leading to high influence of the Maelstrom. The name derives from a rumor of a wizard manifested by the Maelstrom into this reality that wanders the nearly impassable cliffs that line the shore.

### Redrock

A sparsely populated region of sand and coarse dirt. Vegatition is limited here due to the raw terrain.

### Midland

The most populated of the regions of the continent, Midland is a composed of forest, hills, and plains dotted with city-states due to the high occurrence of Wayland artifacts.

### Brook Hills

A set of undulating hills that rise slowly from the east to the west. The area of composed open grass and low trees throughout. It's name comes from a plethora of brooks that run between and across the hills.

### Core's Coast

A stretch of land composed of a mix of rock and grassland, a seeming composite between its neighbors of the rocky Wizard's Crag and the grass hilly plains of Brook Hills.

### Highwall

Highwall is a geographically improbable line of south-facing cliffs that horizontally span nearly the entire continent. Starting in the east at relatively low height, the cliffs rise in height rapidly to dramatically, near impossible heights on the western most boundary between the Highwall and Core's Coast.

The red-brown rock that composes the entire cliff-line is incredibly hard and shows little signs of crumbling or wear. It is thought, due to the improbably geographical shape of the cliff and strange durability of the rock itself, that the Highwall is the remenant of some dramatic event of the Maelstrom from millenia past.

### Forest Stairs

Forest Stairs begins at the high point of Brook hills and runs upward east to west in elevation alongside the Highwall. It is a land of dense forest of gigantic trees with winding pathways beneath the shaodws of the grand canopy of boughs.

### Barrens

Barrens is a high-desert region with several large city-states surrounded by flat emptiness. Given its location so far north, it is a region where leaving the protection of the city-states' Wayland artifacts is considered immensely dangerous.

### Boundary

Boundary is a line of land that stretches from shore to shore across the continent. It is in constant swirl of the Maelstrom's influence, with some saying the shape of Boundary is not even constant as the reality-deforming effects of the Maelstrom continually change its form. There are no major city-states known to be in this region and even small settlements are not generally known to exist here.

### Far North

The Far North is an artic region where the Maelstrom dominates the vast spans of ice and frozen ranges of grand mountains. Only rumors and legends tell of anyone entering the Far North and returning.
